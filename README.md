[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/twofortyfouram/android-toast-setting-plugin-for-locale.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twofortyfouram/android-display-condition-plugin-for-locale)

# Overview
[Locale](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twofortyfouram.locale) allows developers to create plug-in conditions and settings.  The android-display-condition-plugin-for-locale implements an example plug-in condition.  This project is the final layer of the [Locale Developer Platform documentation](http://www.twofortyfouram.com/developer).

Although there are multiple ways to approach building a plug-in, we recommend forking this project as the starting point.
